"""Policy: decides whether a tool call may run. Toolset.execute is where it's enforced.

Each tool declares a permission: "allow" runs, "ask" goes to the approver. The
approver is chosen per run: a human at the terminal, or "no" when nobody's there.
Whether a risky tool is safe depends on where it runs, so that choice belongs to
the run, not to the agent. (To keep an agent away from a tool, don't list it.)

This module imports nothing from the rest of the harness at runtime, so anything
can import it without creating an import cycle.
