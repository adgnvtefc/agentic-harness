"""Tracer: records what happened in a run, one JSON object per line (JSONL).

This file *is* the trace format. The agent reports what happened (start,
model_response, tool_call, finish); the methods here decide what gets recorded.
Anything that reads traces later only needs to look here.

One Tracer = one run = one file. Whoever creates the tracer owns its lifetime with
`with Tracer(path) as tracer:`, which also guarantees the trace ends with exactly
one run_end, even if the run crashes or is interrupted.

Each line is written and flushed immediately, so a run that crashes or is killed
still leaves a trace up to the moment it died. Events are also kept in memory
(`tracer.events`), which is what tests and end-of-run summaries read.
